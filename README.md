# dotDigital

Here I saved some special code for a DotDigital (DotMailer). 

### Tips and Trick:
- DD shrink JPG to content width. This is a problem to use JPG for retina and other high resolution displays. To bypass this problem you can just change the .jpn -> .png in file name and upload it to DD. It will think this is a PNG and will not reduice this size


### Notes:
- It should take up to 1 hour to show up as webinsight data on Dotdigital, unfortunately, there isn't a way to push that data manually.
